![A beautifully colored mama titi (*Saimiri oerstedii oersted*) and her baby](images/costa-rica-puntarenas-titi-monkey-quepos.jpg)

## Preliminary

```{r}
install.packages(c("prettydoc", "manipulate"), repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
library(prettydoc)
library(manipulate)
```

### Poisson Distribution

For the Poisson Distribution, the PMF is

$f(x) = \frac{\lambda^x e^{-\lambda}}{x!}$

Where x = {0, 1, 2, ...} and $\mu_X = \lambda$ and $\sigma^2_X = \lambda$

## Question 1

What is the probability she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

```{r}
#| label: Question 1

a1 <- ppois(8, 15, lower.tail=FALSE)
print(paste0("The probability of observing more than 8 calls is ", a1))
```

## Question 2

What is the probability that she will observe 0 calls?

```{r}
#| label: Question 2

a2 <- dpois(0, 15)
print(paste0("The probability of observing exactly 0 calls is ", a2))
```

## Question 3

What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls?

```{r}
#| label: Question 3

a3 <- dpois(3, 15)
print(paste0("The probability of observing exactly 3 calls is ", a3))
```

## Question 4

Plot the relevant Poisson Distribution

```{r}
#| label: Question 4

x <- 0:30 # range of values for x
l = 15 # mean (lambda)
probset <- dpois(x = x, lambda = l)
barplot(probset, names.arg = x, space = 0, xlab = "x", ylab = "Pr(X = x)", main = "Probability Mass Function", col="lightblue")
```

## Question 5

Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

```{r}
#| label: Question 5

d <- rpois(n=104, lambda=15)
summary(d)
```

## Question 6

### 6.1

Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30.

```{r}
#| label: Question 6.1

hist(d, xlim=c(0, 30), xlab="x", ylab="Frequency", main="Distribution of Simulated Observations", col="bisque2")
```

### 6.2

How does your histogram compare to the shape of the PMF you plotted above?

> The simulated observations follow the general shape of the PMF. When I increased n from 104 to 10\^4, the shape was even more similar because as n increases the histogram will converge on the PMF (where n = infinity)
